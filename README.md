## Prototype Development for Image Captioning Using the BLIP Model and Gradio Framework

### AIM:
To design and deploy a prototype application for image captioning by utilizing the BLIP image-captioning model and integrating it with the Gradio UI framework for user interaction and evaluation.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly application that can generate accurate and descriptive captions for images. Leveraging the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) model, this system aims to bridge the gap between visual and textual data, providing a seamless user experience for image captioning. By integrating with Gradio, the application will allow easy input of images and display the generated captions instantly.
### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Model Selection & Data Preprocessing

#### STEP 2: Caption Generation & Gradio Interface Design

#### STEP 3: Model Deployment

### PROGRAM:
```
# Import necessary libraries
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration
import gradio as gr
from PIL import Image

# Load the BLIP model and processor
model_name = "Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base"
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Function to generate image captions
def generate_caption(image):
    # Preprocess the input image
    inputs = processor(image, return_tensors="pt")
    # Generate the caption
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
    # Decode the generated caption
    caption = processor.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return caption

# Create Gradio interface
iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=generate_caption,
    inputs=gr.Image(type="pil", label="Upload Image"),
    outputs="text",
    title="Image Captioning Prototype",
    description="Upload an image to get a descriptive caption using the BLIP model."
)


iface.launch(share="True")
```

### RESULT:
A fully functional image captioning prototype that leverages the BLIP model and Gradio framework, enabling users to interactively upload images and view captions generated by the model. This prototype demonstrates the ability to bridge visual data with natural language, offering a practical application in areas such as accessibility, content generation, and AI-driven image understanding.
